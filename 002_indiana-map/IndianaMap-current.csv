to define their State and local legislative districts, as well as the districts they
define for election of members to the U.S. House of Representatives. In a
nationwide cooperative program for the 1980 census, the Census Bureau
gave States the opportunity to request use of these election precinct boundaries as the boundaries of census enumeration districts (EDs) or, in some
areas, census blocks. The Census Bureau began using the term voting districts as it began planning for the 1990 census. This chapter describes the
events that led to the development of the VTD program for the 1980 and
1990 censuses, and briefly explains the operations and procedures the

When STATSGO data are overlayed with other data layers, such as land use data, caution must be used in generating statistics on the co-occurence of the land use data with the soil data. The composition of the STATSGO map unit can be characterized independently for the land use and for the soil component, but there are no data on their joint occurrence at a more detailed level. Analysis of the overlayed data should be on a map polygon basis. Additional political, watershed, or other boundaries may be intersected with the soil data. Although the composition of each political and watershed unit may be described in terms of the STATSGO map units, information is not available to assign the components to the boundary units with full accuracy. As with the land use categories, the analysis should be restricted to the classified components. The approximate minimum area delineated is 625 hectares (1,544 acres), which is represented on a 1:250,000-scale map by an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch). Linear delineations are not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width. The number of delineations per 1:250,000 quadrangle typically is 100 to 200, but may range up to 400. Delineations depict the dominant soils making up the landscape. Other dissimilar soils, too small to be delineated, are present within a delineation. Digital enlargements of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Feature data for some data elements may be incomplete or missing. Where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the area from analysis. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.""

Current block groups do not always maintain these same block number to block group relationships due to boundary and feature changes that occur throughout the decade. For example, block 3001 might move due to a change in the census tract boundary. Even if the block is no longer in block group 3, the block number (3001) will not change. However, the GEOID for that block, identifying block group 3, would remain the same in the attribute information in the TIGER/Line shapefiles because block GEOIDs are always built using the decennial geographic codes. Block groups delineated for the 2020 Census generally contain 600 to 3,000 people. Local participants delineated most block groups as part of the Census Bureau's PSAP. The Census Bureau delineated block groups only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant. A block group usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains one or more block groups and block groups have unique numbers within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, block groups never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and AIANNH areas. Block groups have a valid range of zero (0) through nine (9). Block groups beginning with a zero generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas.

This shapefile represents  the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic materials  throughout Indiana.    The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground  shaking. NEHRP links the physical properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave  velocity propagation, to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of their  performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A through F, the correct NEHRP soil  class is best determined from the average shear-wave velocity of the soil column.    Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5):    A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08.  Note that Class A is not present in Indiana.    B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0.    C - Hard and (or) stiff to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760 meters  per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2.    D - Sands, silts, and (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180 to 360  meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6.    E - Small to moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index greater than 20,  moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is less than 180 meters per second; amplification  factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5.    F - Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable soils, quick  and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification  factor is not applicable.    The following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35:    ""The distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the response of geologic  materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven shear-wave velocities were measured in soft  sediments at various localities throughout Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole  methods in freshly augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave profiles  from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile from one other site in Vanderburgh  County. These data, coupled with the thickness of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the  potential amplification of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining the  response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having an epicenter within Indiana  or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance the performance of the computer program HAZUS,  developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess  damage scenarios.    ""Plate 1 of this report, a map of Indiana at a scale of 1:500,000 showing the predicted response of geologic  materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended only for regional planning purposes and is not a  substitute for on-site shear-wave measurements and geotechnical data.

The PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all open space public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee (the owner of the property has full and irrevocable ownership of the land); however, permanent and long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. 'Wilderness Area'), Executive (e.g. 'National Monument'), and administrative designations (e.g. 'Area of Critical Environmental Concern') documented in agency management plans are also included. The PAD-US strives to be a complete inventory of U.S. public land and other protected areas, compiling “best available” data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The PAD-US geodatabase maps and describes areas using thirty-six attributes and five separate feature classes representing the U.S. protected areas network: Fee (ownership parcels), Designation, Easement, Marine, Proclamation and Other Planning Boundaries. An additional Combined feature class includes the full PAD-US inventory to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the Combined layer allows users to extract data types as needed. A Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table (PADUS3_0Combined_Federal_Data_References) facilitates the extraction of authoritative federal data provided or recommended by managing agencies from the Combined PAD-US inventory. This PAD-US Version 3.0 dataset includes a variety of updates from the previous Version 2.1 dataset (USGS, 2020, https://doi.org/10.5066/P92QM3NT ), achieving goals to: 1) Annually update and improve spatial data representing the federal estate for PAD-US applications; 2) Update state and local lands data as state data-steward and PAD-US Team resources allow; and 3) Automate data translation efforts to increase PAD-US update efficiency. The following list summarizes the integration of ""best available"" spatial data to ensure public lands and other protected areas from all jurisdictions are represented in the PAD-US (other data were transferred from PAD-US 2.1). Federal updates - The USGS remains committed to updating federal fee owned lands data and major designation changes in annual PAD-US updates, where authoritative data provided directly by managing agencies are available or alternative data sources are recommended. The following is a list of updates or revisions associated with the federal estate: 1) Major update of the Federal estate (fee ownership parcels, easement interest, and management designations where available), including authoritative data from 8 agencies: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau), Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The federal theme in PAD-US is developed in close collaboration with the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Federal Lands Working Group (FLWG, https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-govunits/federal-lands-workgroup/ ). 2) Improved the representation (boundaries and attributes) of the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lands, in collaboration with agency data-stewards, in response to feedback from the PAD-US Team and stakeholders. 3) Added a Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table (PADUS3_0Combined_Federal_Data_References) to the PAD-US 3.0 geodatabase to facilitate the extraction (by Data Provider, Dataset Name, and/or Aggregator Source) of authoritative data provided directly (or recommended) by federal managing agencies from the full PAD-US inventory. A summary of the number of records (Frequency) and calculated GIS Acres (vs Documented Acres) associated with features provided by each Aggregator Source is included; however, the number of records may vary from source data as the ""State Name"" standard is applied to national files. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the table and geodatabase describe the data type to highlight overlapping features in the full inventory (e.g. Designation features often overlap Fee features) and to assist users in building queries for applications as needed. 4) Scripted the translation of the Department of Defense, Census Bureau, and Natural Resource Conservation Service source data into the PAD-US format to increase update efficiency. 5) Revised conservation measures (GAP Status Code, IUCN Category) to more accurately represent protected and conserved areas. For example, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Waterfowl Production Area Wetland Easements changed from GAP Status Code 2 to 4 as spatial data currently represents the complete parcel (about 10.54 million acres primarily in North Dakota and South Dakota). Only aliquot parts of these parcels are documented under wetland easement (1.64 million acres). These acreages are provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and are referenced in the PAD-US geodatabase Easement feature class 'Comments' field. State updates - The USGS is committed to building capacity in the state data-steward network and the PAD-US Team to increase the frequency of state land updates, as resources allow. The USGS supported efforts to significantly increase state inventory completeness with the integration of local parks data in the PAD-US 2.1, and developed a state-to-PAD-US data translation script during PAD-US 3.0 development to pilot in future updates. Additional efforts are in progress to support the technical and organizational strategies needed to increase the frequency of state updates. The PAD-US 3.0 included major updates to the following three states: 1) California - added or updated state, regional, local, and nonprofit lands data from the California Protected Areas Database (CPAD), managed by GreenInfo Network, and integrated conservation and recreation measure changes following review coordinated by the data-steward with state managing agencies. Developed a data translation Python script (see Process Step 2 Source Data Documentation) in collaboration with the data-steward to increase the accuracy and efficiency of future PAD-US updates from CPAD. 2) Virginia - added or updated state, local, and nonprofit protected areas data (and removed legacy data) from the Virginia Conservation Lands Database, provided by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation's Natural Heritage Program, and integrated conservation and recreation measure changes following review by the data-steward. 3) West Virginia - added or updated state, local, and nonprofit protected areas data provided by the West Virginia University, GIS Technical Center.

""The ecoregions shown here have been derived from Omernik (1987) and from refinements of Omernik's framework that have been made for other projects.
These ongoing or recently completed projects, conducted in collaboration with
the U.S. EPA regional offices and with state resource management agencies,
involve refining ecoregions, defining subregions, and locating sets of
reference sites.  Designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental
resource management, ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and
the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally
similar.  The most immediate needs are to develop regional biological
criteria and water quality standards and to set management goals for nonpoint
source pollution.

The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological
regions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the
composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences
in ecosystem quality and integrity (Wiken 1986; Omernik 1987, 1995).  These
phenomena include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land
use, wildlife,  and hydrology.  The relative importance of each characteristic
varies from one ecological region to another regardless of the hierarchical
level.  Because of possible confusion with other meanings of terms for
different levels of ecologic regions, a Roman numeral classification scheme
has been adopted for this effort.  Level I is the coarsest level, dividing
North America into nine ecological regions whereas at Level II the continent
is subdivided into 32 classes.  Level III is the hierarchical level shown on
this map. For portions of the United States the ecoregions have been further
subdivided to level IV.  The applications of the ecoregions are explained in
Gallant et al. (1989) and in reports and publications from the state and
regional projects.  For additional information, contact James M. Omernik,

TrueWind has also produced data files of the predicted wind speed frequency distribution and speed and energy by direction. The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data. ""The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m. ""The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails. The main reason for this wind resource distribution pattern is that the land is much more forested in the southern half of the state than in the northern half.

TrueWind has also produced data files of the predicted wind speed frequency distribution and speed and energy by direction. The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data. ""The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m. ""The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails. The main reason for this wind resource distribution pattern is that the land is much more forested in the southern half of the state than in the northern half. Topography also plays a role, as does the track of the jet stream.""","MesoMap,atmosphere,atmospheric simulation,alternative energy,wind map,wind energy,wind speed,wind resource,wind power,wind,energy","Mean Wind Speed at Height of 100 Meters above Ground, Derived from Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System and WindMap","","Indiana Geological Survey, Indiana Department of Commerce, TrueWind Solutions LLC, National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)","CREDIT It is required that the Indiana Geological Survey be cited in any products generated from this data.

Recycling electronics ensures these materials are safely managed and that valuable materials such as steel, glass, and plastic, as well as precious metals such as copper, gold, tin, silicon, and aluminum are reclaimed for the manufacturing of new products. Reusing and recycling raw materials from e-waste conserves natural resources and avoids pollution.

their 4-character census block number (e.g., Blocks 3001, 3002, 3003 to 3999 in census tract 1210.02
belong to block group 3). Current block groups do not always maintain these same block number to block
group relationships due to boundary and feature changes that occur throughout the decade. For example,
block 3001 might move due to a change in the census tract boundary. Even if the block is no longer in
block group 3, the block number (3001) will not change. However, the GEOID for that block, identifying
block group 3, would remain the same in the attribute information in the TIGER/Line shapefiles because
block GEOIDs are always built using the decennial geographic codes.
Block groups delineated for the 2020 Census generally contain 600 to 3,000 people. Local participants
delineated most block groups as part of the Census Bureau's PSAP. The Census Bureau delineated
block groups only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the Census Bureau
could not identify a potential local participant.
A block group usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains one or more block groups
and block groups have unique numbers within census tract. Within the standard census geographic
hierarchy, block groups never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of
county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and AIANNH areas.
Block groups have a valid range of zero (0) through nine (9). Block groups beginning with a zero
generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract
boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the 3-mile territorial sea limit, the Census Bureau delineated
some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.","Population,Census,Block Group","Block group boundaries from the 2020 decennial census of Indiana, provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.

clay layers can constitute capping and confining units for aquifers, such layers are of hydrologic
significance. Water wells are usually drilled to the uppermost major water-bearing unit and are not

line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads). Generally, census blocks are small in area (e.g., a block in
a city). Census blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, irregular, and bounded by a variety of
features (e.g., roads, streams, and/or transmission line rights-of-way). In remote areas, census blocks
may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto
Rico, and the Island Areas. Blocks do not cross the boundaries of any entity for which the Census Bureau
tabulates data. (See Figures 12 and 13).
Census Block Numbers—Census blocks are numbered uniquely within the boundaries of each state,
county, census tract with a 4-character census block number. The first character of the tabulation block

This data is also available from the USGS as a service at https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/nhd/MapServer Abstract: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. Use the metadata link, http://nhdgeo.usgs.gov/metadata/nhd_high.htm, for additional information. Purpose: The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all.","DNR,NHD,Water,stream,river","This dataset is a view of the AREA features of the national hydrologic dataset These features contain linear water bodies including Canals/Ditches, Streams/Rivers, Submerged Streams, Dams/Weirs, Spillways, Lock Chambers, Rapids, and Inundation Areas.","","","This data set was compiled by Indiana State Geographic Information Office, using data believed to be accurate; however, a degree of error is inherent in all data.

","Natural Resources Conservation Service, STATSGO metadata reports- ""STATSGO was designed primarily for regional, multicounty, river basin, State, and multistate resource planning, management, and monitoring. STATSGO data are not detailed enough to make interpretations at a county level. This soil survey product is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. The use of these data is not restricted and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others; however, they are responsible for its appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to state or local regulatory programs. When STATSGO data are overlayed with other data layers, such as land use data, caution must be used in generating statistics on the co-occurence of the land use data with the soil data. The composition of the STATSGO map unit can be characterized independently for the land use and for the soil component, but there are no data on their joint occurrence at a more detailed level. Analysis of the overlayed data should be on a map polygon basis. Additional political, watershed, or other boundaries may be intersected with the soil data. Although the composition of each political and watershed unit may be described in terms of the STATSGO map units, information is not available to assign the components to the boundary units with full accuracy. As with the land use categories, the analysis should be restricted to the classified components. The approximate minimum area delineated is 625 hectares (1,544 acres), which is represented on a 1:250,000-scale map by an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch). Linear delineations are not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width. The number of delineations per 1:250,000 quadrangle typically is 100 to 200, but may range up to 400. Delineations depict the dominant soils making up the landscape. Other dissimilar soils, too small to be delineated, are present within a delineation. Digital enlargements of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Feature data for some data elements may be incomplete or missing. Where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the area from analysis. Digital data files are periodically updated.

The PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all open space public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee (the owner of the property has full and irrevocable ownership of the land); however, permanent and long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. 'Wilderness Area'), Executive (e.g. 'National Monument'), and administrative designations (e.g. 'Area of Critical Environmental Concern') documented in agency management plans are also included. The PAD-US strives to be a complete inventory of U.S. public land and other protected areas, compiling “best available” data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The PAD-US geodatabase maps and describes areas using thirty-six attributes and five separate feature classes representing the U.S. protected areas network: Fee (ownership parcels), Designation, Easement, Marine, Proclamation and Other Planning Boundaries. An additional Combined feature class includes the full PAD-US inventory to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the Combined layer allows users to extract data types as needed. A Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table (PADUS3_0Combined_Federal_Data_References) facilitates the extraction of authoritative federal data provided or recommended by managing agencies from the Combined PAD-US inventory. This PAD-US Version 3.0 dataset includes a variety of updates from the previous Version 2.1 dataset (USGS, 2020, https://doi.org/10.5066/P92QM3NT ), achieving goals to: 1) Annually update and improve spatial data representing the federal estate for PAD-US applications; 2) Update state and local lands data as state data-steward and PAD-US Team resources allow; and 3) Automate data translation efforts to increase PAD-US update efficiency. The following list summarizes the integration of ""best available"" spatial data to ensure public lands and other protected areas from all jurisdictions are represented in the PAD-US (other data were transferred from PAD-US 2.1). Federal updates - The USGS remains committed to updating federal fee owned lands data and major designation changes in annual PAD-US updates, where authoritative data provided directly by managing agencies are available or alternative data sources are recommended. The following is a list of updates or revisions associated with the federal estate: 1) Major update of the Federal estate (fee ownership parcels, easement interest, and management designations where available), including authoritative data from 8 agencies: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau), Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The federal theme in PAD-US is developed in close collaboration with the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Federal Lands Working Group (FLWG, https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-govunits/federal-lands-workgroup/ ). 2) Improved the representation (boundaries and attributes) of the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lands, in collaboration with agency data-stewards, in response to feedback from the PAD-US Team and stakeholders. 3) Added a Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table (PADUS3_0Combined_Federal_Data_References) to the PAD-US 3.0 geodatabase to facilitate the extraction (by Data Provider, Dataset Name, and/or Aggregator Source) of authoritative data provided directly (or recommended) by federal managing agencies from the full PAD-US inventory. A summary of the number of records (Frequency) and calculated GIS Acres (vs Documented Acres) associated with features provided by each Aggregator Source is included; however, the number of records may vary from source data as the ""State Name"" standard is applied to national files. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the table and geodatabase describe the data type to highlight overlapping features in the full inventory (e.g. Designation features often overlap Fee features) and to assist users in building queries for applications as needed. 4) Scripted the translation of the Department of Defense, Census Bureau, and Natural Resource Conservation Service source data into the PAD-US format to increase update efficiency. 5) Revised conservation measures (GAP Status Code, IUCN Category) to more accurately represent protected and conserved areas. For example, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Waterfowl Production Area Wetland Easements changed from GAP Status Code 2 to 4 as spatial data currently represents the complete parcel (about 10.54 million acres primarily in North Dakota and South Dakota). Only aliquot parts of these parcels are documented under wetland easement (1.64 million acres). These acreages are provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and are referenced in the PAD-US geodatabase Easement feature class 'Comments' field. State updates - The USGS is committed to building capacity in the state data-steward network and the PAD-US Team to increase the frequency of state land updates, as resources allow. The USGS supported efforts to significantly increase state inventory completeness with the integration of local parks data in the PAD-US 2.1, and developed a state-to-PAD-US data translation script during PAD-US 3.0 development to pilot in future updates. Additional efforts are in progress to support the technical and organizational strategies needed to increase the frequency of state updates. The PAD-US 3.0 included major updates to the following three states: 1) California - added or updated state, regional, local, and nonprofit lands data from the California Protected Areas Database (CPAD), managed by GreenInfo Network, and integrated conservation and recreation measure changes following review coordinated by the data-steward with state managing agencies. Developed a data translation Python script (see Process Step 2 Source Data Documentation) in collaboration with the data-steward to increase the accuracy and efficiency of future PAD-US updates from CPAD. 2) Virginia - added or updated state, local, and nonprofit protected areas data (and removed legacy data) from the Virginia Conservation Lands Database, provided by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation's Natural Heritage Program, and integrated conservation and recreation measure changes following review by the data-steward. 3) West Virginia - added or updated state, local, and nonprofit protected areas data provided by the West Virginia University, GIS Technical Center.

These reports included maps showing extent of the Hymera Coal Member (Dugger Formation, Pennsylvanian). The extent maps were based on coal-test records, mine-map notations,  and interpretations of geophysical logs that are included in the files of the Indiana Geological Survey.    Since 1980, staff members of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) have also collected and entered coal resource information into the NCRDS Database as a cooperative project  with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The purpose of NCRDS Database is to provide a means of rapid retrieval of point-source coal resource information, including coal  location, extent, and other parameters. Based on all available NCRDS data and data provided by Phil Ames from the Peabody Coal Company as of April 2014, a new map of  Hymera Coal Member extent was created. It is the most current extent map of the Hymera Coal Member. Because additional data on coal extent are obtained by the Indiana  Geological Survey on an annual basis, interested users may wish to contact the IGS for information on these more up-to-date sources.","geoscientificInformation,energy,Indiana Geological Survey (IGS),National Coal Resources Data System (NCRDS),coal,thickness,coal thickness,Hymera Coal Member,Dugger Formation,Carbondale Group,Pennsylvanian,Indiana,Daviess County,Greene County,Gibson County,Knox County,Sullivan County,Pike County,Posey County,Vanderburgh County,Vigo County,Warrick County","COAL_HYMERA_THICKNESS_IN_2014 was was created to provide a multi-county digital shapefile, suitable for use in a GIS, from Indiana Geological Survey National Coal

Current block groups do not always maintain these same block number to block group relationships due to boundary and feature changes that occur throughout the decade. For example, block 3001 might move due to a change in the census tract boundary. Even if the block is no longer in block group 3, the block number (3001) will not change. However, the GEOID for that block, identifying block group 3, would remain the same in the attribute information in the TIGER/Line shapefiles because block GEOIDs are always built using the decennial geographic codes. Block groups delineated for the 2020 Census generally contain 600 to 3,000 people. Local participants delineated most block groups as part of the Census Bureau's PSAP. The Census Bureau delineated block groups only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant. A block group usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains one or more block groups and block groups have unique numbers within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, block groups never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and AIANNH areas. Block groups have a valid range of zero (0) through nine (9). Block groups beginning with a zero generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas.

TrueWind has also produced data files of the predicted wind speed frequency distribution and speed and energy by direction. The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data. ""The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m. ""The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails. The main reason for this wind resource distribution pattern is that the land is much more forested in the southern half of the state than in the northern half.

""The ecoregions shown here have been derived from Omernik (1987) and from refinements of Omernik's framework that have been made for other projects.
These ongoing or recently completed projects, conducted in collaboration with
the U.S. EPA regional offices and with state resource management agencies,
involve refining ecoregions, defining subregions, and locating sets of
reference sites.  Designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental
resource management, ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and
the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally
similar.  The most immediate needs are to develop regional biological
criteria and water quality standards and to set management goals for nonpoint
source pollution.

The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological
regions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the
composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences
in ecosystem quality and integrity (Wiken 1986; Omernik 1987, 1995).  These
phenomena include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land
use, wildlife,  and hydrology.  The relative importance of each characteristic
varies from one ecological region to another regardless of the hierarchical
level.  Because of possible confusion with other meanings of terms for
different levels of ecologic regions, a Roman numeral classification scheme
has been adopted for this effort.  Level I is the coarsest level, dividing
North America into nine ecological regions whereas at Level II the continent
is subdivided into 32 classes.  Level III is the hierarchical level shown on
this map. For portions of the United States the ecoregions have been further
subdivided to level IV.  The applications of the ecoregions are explained in
Gallant et al. (1989) and in reports and publications from the state and
regional projects.  For additional information, contact James M. Omernik,
U.S. EPA National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory (NHEERL),

This shapefile represents  the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic materials  throughout Indiana.    The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground  shaking. NEHRP links the physical properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave  velocity propagation, to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of their  performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A through F, the correct NEHRP soil  class is best determined from the average shear-wave velocity of the soil column.    Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5):    A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08.  Note that Class A is not present in Indiana.    B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0.    C - Hard and (or) stiff to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760 meters  per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2.    D - Sands, silts, and (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180 to 360  meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6.    E - Small to moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index greater than 20,  moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is less than 180 meters per second; amplification  factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5.    F - Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable soils, quick  and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification  factor is not applicable.    The following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35:    ""The distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the response of geologic  materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven shear-wave velocities were measured in soft  sediments at various localities throughout Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole  methods in freshly augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave profiles  from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile from one other site in Vanderburgh  County. These data, coupled with the thickness of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the  potential amplification of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining the  response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having an epicenter within Indiana  or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance the performance of the computer program HAZUS,  developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess  damage scenarios.    ""Plate 1 of this report, a map of Indiana at a scale of 1:500,000 showing the predicted response of geologic  materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended only for regional planning purposes and is not a  substitute for on-site shear-wave measurements and geotechnical data.

TrueWind has also produced data files of the predicted wind speed frequency distribution and speed and energy by direction. The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data. ""The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m. ""The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails. The main reason for this wind resource distribution pattern is that the land is much more forested in the southern half of the state than in the northern half.

including coal location, elevation, depth, and other parameters. Based on all available data as of October 2010, a new map of Seelyville Coal Member elevation
was created. It is the most current elevation map of the Seelyville Coal Member. Because additional data on coal elevations are obtained by the Indiana Geological
Survey on an annual basis, interested users may wish to contact the IGS for information on these more up-to-date sources.","geoscientificInformation,energy,Indiana Geological Survey (IGS),National Coal Resources Data System (NCRDS),coal,elevation,coal elevation,geology,Seelyville Coal Member,Linton Formation,Carbondale Group,Pennsylvanian,Indiana,Clay County,Daviess County,Dubois County,Greene County,Gibson County,Knox County,Sullivan County,Parke County,Pike County,Posey County,Spencer County,Vanderburgh County,Vermillion County,Vigo County,Warrick County","COAL_SEELYVILLE_ELEVATION_NCRDS_IN_2012.SHP was created to provide a multi-county digital shapefile, suitable for use in a GIS, from the Indiana Geological Survey

Some areas may also include additional subdivisions representing the 14- and 16-digit hydrologic unit (HU). At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. The HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit.

the CDPs are located. The Census Bureau defines CDP boundaries in cooperation with local partners as
part of the PSAP. CDP boundaries usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent

Local participants review and update census tracts prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau’s PSAP. The Census Bureau updates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. 4-24 Census tracts generally have a population size of 1,200 to 8,000 people with an optimum size of 4,000 people. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Ideally, census tract boundaries remain stable over time to facilitate statistical comparisons from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, significant changes in population may result in splitting or combining census tracts. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. Census tract boundaries may follow legal boundaries (e.g., MCD or incorporated place boundaries in some states to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses). State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.

This data is also available from the USGS as a service at https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/nhd/MapServer Abstract: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. Use the metadata link, http://nhdgeo.usgs.gov/metadata/nhd_high.htm, for additional information. Purpose: The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all.","DNR,NHD,Water,stream,river","This dataset is a view of all Waterbody features from the national hydrologic dataset for Indiana. In Indiana, this includes Lakes/Ponds, Reservoirs, and Swamps/Marshes.  Lakes/Ponds and Reservoirs must have a Reachcode attribute per the USGS, while Swamps/Marshes may have a reachcode.

The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data. ""The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m. ""The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails.

The GNIS contains information about physical geographic features of many types in the United States, associated areas, and Antarctica, current and historical, but not including roads and highways or cultural features.

Boone County had townships misattributed as Zionsville City and Whitestown Town and had associated incorporated are boundaries overlapping the real civil township boundary. Civil township boundaries from the 2023 Data Harvest were used when possible to correct geometry, and the neighboring census township boundaries to maintain topology when needed. Eagle and Union townships do not have a populated GEOID since the corrected boundary does not correspond to a census MCD geography to avoid incorrect joins to census tabular data by end users.

represent many kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. MCDs include the following areas:
American Indian
Reservations, Assessment
districts, Barrios, Barrios-pueblo, Boroughs, Census
subdistricts, Charter
townships, Commissioner
districts, Counties, Election districts, Election precincts, Gores, Grants, Locations, Magisterial districts, Parish governing
authority districts, Plantations, Precincts, Purchases, Supervisor’s districts, Towns, Townships. The Census Bureau recognizes MCDs in 29 states, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. The District of
Columbia has no primary divisions, and the Census Bureau treats the incorporated place of Washington
as an MCD equivalent for statistical purposes. In 23 states, all or some incorporated places are not part of
any MCD. These places also serve as primary legal county subdivisions and have a FIPS MCD code that
is the same as the FIPS place code. The GNIS codes also match for those entities. In other states,
incorporated places are part of the MCDs where located or the pattern is mixed—some incorporated
places are independent of MCDs, and others are included within one or more MCDs. The MCDs in 12
states (see Figure 17) also serve as general-purpose local governments that generally can perform the

The purpose of the program is to reduce the amount of electronic waste being sent to Indiana landfills and to ensure that hazardous substances found in electronic waste are being managed in an appropriate and environmentally responsible manner. The following is excerpted from the ""Electronic Waste"" web page of IDEM, (for additional information please visit the website at the following URL - https://www.in.gov/idem/recycle/2352.htm): Electronics contain heavy metals, including lead, mercury, cadmium, and hexavalent chromium that can be harmful if released into the environment. Recycling electronics ensures these materials are safely managed and that valuable materials such as steel, glass, and plastic, as well as precious metals such as copper, gold, tin, silicon, and aluminum are reclaimed for the manufacturing of new products. Reusing and recycling raw materials from e-waste conserves natural resources and avoids pollution.

block group 3, would remain the same in the attribute information in the TIGER/Line shapefiles because
block GEOIDs are always built using the decennial geographic codes.
Block groups delineated for the 2020 Census generally contain 600 to 3,000 people. Local participants
delineated most block groups as part of the Census Bureau's PSAP. The Census Bureau delineated
block groups only where a local or tribal government declined to participate or where the Census Bureau
could not identify a potential local participant.
A block group usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains one or more block groups
and block groups have unique numbers within census tract. Within the standard census geographic
hierarchy, block groups never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of
county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and AIANNH areas.
Block groups have a valid range of zero (0) through nine (9). Block groups beginning with a zero
generally are in coastal and Great Lakes water and territorial seas. Rather than extending a census tract
boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the 3-mile territorial sea limit, the Census Bureau delineated
some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.","Population,Census,Block Group","Block group boundaries from the 2020 decennial census of Indiana, provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The following explanation of the iLITH Database appears in Open-File Study 00-8 of the Indiana Geological  Survey:    ""iLITH is a Microsoft Access database containing GIS capabilities that allows users to interact with  a portion of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) Water-Well Record Database. iLITH  differs from the IDNR database in that lithologic descriptions and drilling contractor names have  been standardized, locational information for ~104,000 water-well logs has been verified, and the  spatial information in the database has been standardized for use with USGS digital elevation data  and US Census Bureau Tiger data. The iLITH graphical interface facilitates efficient interaction  between the user and the database.""    Using Microsoft Access, queries were constructed that summed the total thickness of clay units for  each well. Units with the following designations were included in the summation: ""clay,"" ""clay and  gravel,"" ""clay and sand,"" ""clay and stone,"" ""clay with gravel,"" ""clay with gravel seams,"" ""clay with  sand,"" ""clay with sand streaks,"" ""mud,"" ""mud and gravel,"" and ""mud and sand.""

Because
clay layers can constitute capping and confining units for aquifers, such layers are of hydrologic
significance. Water wells are usually drilled to the uppermost major water-bearing unit and are not
typically drilled through the entire thickness of surficial unconsolidated materials. Therefore, logs
of water wells provide a source of data regarding the vertical distribution of coarse- and fine-

line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads). Generally, census blocks are small in area (e.g., a block in
a city). Census blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, irregular, and bounded by a variety of
features (e.g., roads, streams, and/or transmission line rights-of-way). In remote areas, census blocks
may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto
Rico, and the Island Areas. Blocks do not cross the boundaries of any entity for which the Census Bureau
tabulates data. (See Figures 12 and 13).
Census Block Numbers—Census blocks are numbered uniquely within the boundaries of each state,
county, census tract with a 4-character census block number. The first character of the tabulation block

This data is also available from the USGS as a service at https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/nhd/MapServer Abstract: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. Use the metadata link, http://nhdgeo.usgs.gov/metadata/nhd_high.htm, for additional information. Purpose: The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all.","DNR,NHD,Water,stream,river","This dataset is a view of the AREA features of the national hydrologic dataset These features contain linear water bodies including Canals/Ditches, Streams/Rivers, Submerged Streams, Dams/Weirs, Spillways, Lock Chambers, Rapids, and Inundation Areas.","","","This data set was compiled by Indiana State Geographic Information Office, using data believed to be accurate; however, a degree of error is inherent in all data.

Watershed boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. This dataset represents the hydrologic unit boundaries to the 12-digit (6th level) for the entire United States. Some areas may also include additional subdivisions representing the 14- and 16-digit hydrologic unit (HU). At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. The HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit.

The NHD also integrates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee."" ""The NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another.

Both are made up of existing trails, trails under development, and proposed trails that are planned and actively supported.  The difference is that Visionary Trails tend to have a higher degree of certainty of actually being completed than Potential Visionary. Potential Visionary Trails tend to have less of a degree of public planning and/or support, but show some promise of completion. The Indiana Visionary Trails System is not a construction plan or a system that the State is unilaterally building. Instead it is a tool to help encourage Indiana’s trail providers and developers, which most often are units of local governments and non-profits, to work together to complete and connect these corridors.

Wind farm facility location data from various wind and energy industry sources were used to search for and digitize turbines not in existing databases. Technical specifications for turbines were assigned based on the wind turbine make and model as described in literature, specifications listed in the Federal Aviation Administration Digital Obstacle File, and information on the turbine manufacturer’s website. Some facility and turbine information on make and model did not exist or was difficult to obtain. Thus, uncertainty may exist for certain turbine specifications.

S. Army Corps of Engineers (Louisville, Detroit and Chicago districts) and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, from 1965 – 1973. These maps depict stream mileages in tenths of a mile (with exceptions) mapped on USGS 7 ½ minute quadrangle maps, at a scale of 1:24000. Methodology for determining stream mileage largely follows the document “River Mileage Measurement”, Water Resources Council, 1968. Points representing each tenth of a mile were captured by DNR staff using georectified copies of the original source documents. These points are attributed with the stream name as shown on the original documents, and the basin, from the Division of Water standard basin schema. This dataset was developed in 2016. Updated hydrographic dataset sources (namely the USGS National Hydrography Dataset) are captured to a much finer resolution than was possible when this data was originally compiled. Additionally, rivers and streams are dynamic, eroding and depositing material and changing course over time, sometimes significantly.

Local participants review and update census tracts prior to each decennial census as part of the Census
Bureau’s PSAP. The Census Bureau updates census tracts in situations where no local participant
existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts
is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data.
4-24
Census tracts generally have a population size of 1,200 to 8,000 people with an optimum size of 4,000
people. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Ideally,
census tract boundaries remain stable over time to facilitate statistical comparisons from census to
census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development,
and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, significant changes in population may result in
splitting or combining census tracts.
Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. Census tract boundaries may
follow legal boundaries (e.g., MCD or incorporated place boundaries in some states to allow for census
tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged
between censuses). State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard
census geographic hierarchy.
In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas
may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves

The PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all open space public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee (the owner of the property has full and irrevocable ownership of the land); however, permanent and long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. 'Wilderness Area'), Executive (e.g. 'National Monument'), and administrative designations (e.g. 'Area of Critical Environmental Concern') documented in agency management plans are also included. The PAD-US strives to be a complete inventory of U.S. public land and other protected areas, compiling “best available” data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The PAD-US geodatabase maps and describes areas using thirty-six attributes and five separate feature classes representing the U.S. protected areas network: Fee (ownership parcels), Designation, Easement, Marine, Proclamation and Other Planning Boundaries. An additional Combined feature class includes the full PAD-US inventory to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the Combined layer allows users to extract data types as needed. A Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table (PADUS3_0Combined_Federal_Data_References) facilitates the extraction of authoritative federal data provided or recommended by managing agencies from the Combined PAD-US inventory. This PAD-US Version 3.0 dataset includes a variety of updates from the previous Version 2.1 dataset (USGS, 2020, https://doi.org/10.5066/P92QM3NT ), achieving goals to: 1) Annually update and improve spatial data representing the federal estate for PAD-US applications; 2) Update state and local lands data as state data-steward and PAD-US Team resources allow; and 3) Automate data translation efforts to increase PAD-US update efficiency. The following list summarizes the integration of ""best available"" spatial data to ensure public lands and other protected areas from all jurisdictions are represented in the PAD-US (other data were transferred from PAD-US 2.1). Federal updates - The USGS remains committed to updating federal fee owned lands data and major designation changes in annual PAD-US updates, where authoritative data provided directly by managing agencies are available or alternative data sources are recommended. The following is a list of updates or revisions associated with the federal estate: 1) Major update of the Federal estate (fee ownership parcels, easement interest, and management designations where available), including authoritative data from 8 agencies: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau), Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The federal theme in PAD-US is developed in close collaboration with the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Federal Lands Working Group (FLWG, https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-govunits/federal-lands-workgroup/ ). 2) Improved the representation (boundaries and attributes) of the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lands, in collaboration with agency data-stewards, in response to feedback from the PAD-US Team and stakeholders. 3) Added a Federal Data Reference file geodatabase lookup table (PADUS3_0Combined_Federal_Data_References) to the PAD-US 3.0 geodatabase to facilitate the extraction (by Data Provider, Dataset Name, and/or Aggregator Source) of authoritative data provided directly (or recommended) by federal managing agencies from the full PAD-US inventory. A summary of the number of records (Frequency) and calculated GIS Acres (vs Documented Acres) associated with features provided by each Aggregator Source is included; however, the number of records may vary from source data as the ""State Name"" standard is applied to national files. The Feature Class (FeatClass) field in the table and geodatabase describe the data type to highlight overlapping features in the full inventory (e.g. Designation features often overlap Fee features) and to assist users in building queries for applications as needed. 4) Scripted the translation of the Department of Defense, Census Bureau, and Natural Resource Conservation Service source data into the PAD-US format to increase update efficiency. 5) Revised conservation measures (GAP Status Code, IUCN Category) to more accurately represent protected and conserved areas. For example, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Waterfowl Production Area Wetland Easements changed from GAP Status Code 2 to 4 as spatial data currently represents the complete parcel (about 10.54 million acres primarily in North Dakota and South Dakota). Only aliquot parts of these parcels are documented under wetland easement (1.64 million acres). These acreages are provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and are referenced in the PAD-US geodatabase Easement feature class 'Comments' field. State updates - The USGS is committed to building capacity in the state data-steward network and the PAD-US Team to increase the frequency of state land updates, as resources allow. The USGS supported efforts to significantly increase state inventory completeness with the integration of local parks data in the PAD-US 2.1, and developed a state-to-PAD-US data translation script during PAD-US 3.0 development to pilot in future updates. Additional efforts are in progress to support the technical and organizational strategies needed to increase the frequency of state updates. The PAD-US 3.0 included major updates to the following three states: 1) California - added or updated state, regional, local, and nonprofit lands data from the California Protected Areas Database (CPAD), managed by GreenInfo Network, and integrated conservation and recreation measure changes following review coordinated by the data-steward with state managing agencies. Developed a data translation Python script (see Process Step 2 Source Data Documentation) in collaboration with the data-steward to increase the accuracy and efficiency of future PAD-US updates from CPAD. 2) Virginia - added or updated state, local, and nonprofit protected areas data (and removed legacy data) from the Virginia Conservation Lands Database, provided by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation's Natural Heritage Program, and integrated conservation and recreation measure changes following review by the data-steward. 3) West Virginia - added or updated state, local, and nonprofit protected areas data provided by the West Virginia University, GIS Technical Center.

In cooperation with the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), PAD-US also supports global conservation analyses to inform policy decisions ( https://www.protectedplanet.net/country/USA , https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/resources/global-reports ). The dataset is robust and has been expanded in recent years with major additions of local parks data to PAD-US 2.1, to support the recreation, natural resource management, wildfire planning, emergency management, transportation, research, and public health communities.

The U.S. Geological Survey and all contributing data partners shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and (or) contained herein. All information is created with a specific end use or uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. These data were created with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; however, inappropriate uses are listed below. This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that PAD-US will provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, authoritative agency data and field surveys should verify the result. PAD-US is recommended for users seeking general information about more than one agency or organization's lands. Users should seek authoritative source data directly to answer questions regarding one agency or those requiring more frequent updates (See PAD-US Steward Reports for contacts and agency data download locations: http://www.protectedlands.net/data-stewards/ ). The PAD-US includes the best available representation of federally owned lands (meaning a federal agency or the U.S. holds the title records), developed from authoritative source data in direct collaboration with federal agency data-stewards. Several ownership related data gaps exist and USGS provides no legal warranty. Agencies are always the official and best source of their land data and some update more frequently than PAD-US. The FGDC Federal Lands Working Group recommends the use of PAD-US to describe federally managed lands (i.e. “Manager Name” not “Owner Name”), unless spatial data inventory completeness is over 95% and appropriate scale for display is 1:24,000 as illustrated in “State of PAD-US Data” (e.g. USFS, USFWS, NPS, BLM, DOD) - a graphical summary of inventory completeness, appropriate scale, and update frequency at: https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-govunits/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/StateofPADUS_Feb2021.pdf ) . Ultimately, it is the responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked. Furthermore, the database is released on condition that neither the USGS nor the U.S. Government shall be held liable for any damages resulting from its authorized or unauthorized use. Inappropriate uses include: Using PAD-US for applications or analyses associated with one agency or a particular unit (agencies are always the best and authoritative source of their land data and many publish updates more frequently than PAD-US). Using data to map small areas, typically requiring mapping resolution at scale finer than 1:24,000, as boundary quality varies by data source (See ""State of PAD-US Data"") and using aerial photographs or ground surveys in areas where data are incomplete. Combining these data with other data finer than 1:100,000 scale (except for select federal agencies or states identified in ""State of PAD-US Data"") to produce new hybrid maps or answer queries. Generating specific areal measurements from the data finer than the nearest thousand hectares. Representing boundaries as a legal representation for regulation or acquisition.

For NLCD 2006, there are 3 primary data products:  1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map; 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Change Pixels labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness.  Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks:  4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table.","Land Cover,land use,National Land Cover Data (2006)","Land Cover in Indiana, Derived from the 2006 National Land Cover Database (United States Geological Survey, 30-Meter TIFF Image)","","Indiana Geological & Water Survey (IGWS), Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium","LIMITATION OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY - This product is provided ""AS IS"", without any other warranties or conditions, expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties for product quality, or suitability to a particular purpose or use.

TrueWind has also produced data files of the predicted wind speed frequency distribution and speed and energy by direction. The maps and data files are provided on a CD with the ArcReader software, which will enable users to view, print, copy, and query the maps and wind rose data. ""The MesoMap system consists of an integrated set of atmospheric simulation models, databases, and computers and storage systems. At the core of MesoMap is MASS (Mesoscale Atmospheric Simulation System), a numerical weather model, which simulates the physics of the atmosphere. MASS is coupled to a simpler wind flow model, WindMap, which is used to refine the spatial resolution of MASS and account for localized effects of terrain and surface roughness. MASS simulates weather conditions over a region for 366 historical days randomly selected from a 15-year period. When the runs are finished, the results are input into WindMap. In this project, the MASS model was run on a grid spacing of 1.7 km and WindMap on a grid spacing of 200 m. ""The wind maps show that the best wind resource in Indiana is found in the northcentral part of the state. The mean wind speed at 50 m height between Indianapolis, Kokomo, and Lafayette, and to the northwest of Lafayette, is predicted to be in the range of 6.5 to 7 m/s, and the mean wind power is predicted to be about 250 to 350 W/m2, or NREL class 2 to 3. In the rest of northern Indiana, the wind speed tends to be around 0.5 m/s lower, and the wind power is a solid class 2. In southern Indiana, a wind speed of 4.5 to 6 m/s and a wind power class of 1 to 2 prevails. The main reason for this wind resource distribution pattern is that the land is much more forested in the southern half of the state than in the northern half.

created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more
detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology,

Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas
were studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils
were determined.

Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas
on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to
characterize the whole map unit.

tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1-by 2-degree

When data from the Digital General Soil Map of U.S. are overlayed with other data layers, such as land use data, caution must be used in generating statistics on the co-occurence of the land use data with the soil data. The composition of the soil map unit can be characterized independently for the land use and for the soil component, but there are no data on their joint occurrence at a more detailed level. Analysis of the overlayed data should be on a map polygon basis.  Additional political, watershed, or other boundaries may be intersected with the soil data. Although the composition of each political and watershed unit may be described in terms of the soil map units, information is not available to assign the components to the boundary units with full accuracy. As with the land use categories, the analysis should be restricted to the classified components.  The approximate minimum area delineated is 625 hectares (1,544 acres), which is represented on a 1:250,000-scale map by an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch). The approximate minimum area delineated for Alaska is 2,500 hectares (6,176 acres), which is represented on a 1:5000,000-scale map by an area approximately 1 cm by 1 cm (0.4 inch by 0.4 inch).Linear delineations are not less than 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) in width. The number of delineations per 1:250,000 quadrangle typically is 100 to 200, but may range up to 400. Delineations depict the dominant soils making up the landscape. Other dissimilar soils, too small to be delineated, are present within a delineation.  Digital enlargements of these data to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.  Data values for some data elements may be incomplete or missing. Where data are unavailable, a mask should be used to exclude the area from analysis.  The spatial and tabular data used to create this product are periodically updated. Data are versioned, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the product.","en-us","https://gisdata.in.gov/server/rest/services/Hosted/Soil_General_Map_STATSGO/FeatureServer","public","custom","U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service","-88.09789817099994,37.77175093000005,-84.78458087799999,41.76069669300006",""

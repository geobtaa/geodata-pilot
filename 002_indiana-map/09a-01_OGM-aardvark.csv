Abandoned Sand and Pits: Indiana,"","SAND_GRAVEL_PITS_ABANDONED_IN is a point shapefile that shows the locations of abandoned sand and gravel pits in Indiana.

A., 2001, Preliminary database of abandoned sand and gravel pits, Coal and Industrial Minerals Section Memorandum Report 98, Indiana Geological Survey, Bloomington, 3 p., and a CD-ROM.  NOTE: This shapefile includes 2,275 of 2,515 sand and gravel pit locations from the IGS Abandoned Sand and Gravel Pit Database (titled ""PrelimSdGvDB.mdb"") that are located in Indiana and for which the documented location is to the nearest quarter quarter section. The 240 pit locations that were excluded did not have adequate quarter quarter section information that could be processed by Geographix software.  The following discussion is derived from Memorandum Report 98: ""The Microsoft Access 2000 database PrelimSdGvDB.mdb on the enclosed CD contains information about abandoned sand and gravel pits in Indiana. The data contained in this database represents a preliminary stage in a comprehensive compilation of abandoned sand and gravel pit data stored in the files of the Mineral Resources Section of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS). The data were taken from a single Mineral Resources Section file titled ""DATA TABULATION CARDS: Sand and Gravel Pits"" which documents abandoned sand and gravel pits examined by IGS geologists in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Although these data have been assembled into a simple flat-file database they should not be regarded as a final compilation of the above mentioned file nor should they be regarded as a compilation of all abandoned sand and gravel pit information filed in IGS Mineral Resources Section files.

The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile BROWNFIELDS:  ""Indiana defines a brownfield site as a parcel of real estate that is abandoned or inactive; or may not be operated at its appropriate use; and on which expansion, redevelopment, or reuse is complicated; because of the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, a contaminant, petroleum, or a petroleum product that poses a risk to human health and the environment.  As our undeveloped land continues to disappear, we recognize the need to redevelop and reuse land that may have viable buildings and infrastructure already present.  The existence of buildings and infrastructure, and access to transportation resources can lower the costs to a potential developer.  Redevelopment of brownfields properties benefits communities by rejuvenating vacant buildings, increasing the tax base and reducing blight.  Because the potential environmental liability at these properties is unknown, prospective purchasers are unwilling to assume the risk of undetermined potential cleanup costs.  Thus, the properties remain idle.  In response to these issues the IDEM, in conjunction with the Indiana Development Finance Authority,and the Indiana Department of Commerce offers financial assistance in the form of grants and low-interest loans for site assessment, remediation, and demolition.

Census Tract Areas: Indiana,"","CENSUS_TRACTS_TIGER2011_IN.SHP is a polygon shapefile that contains 2011 census tract boundaries for the state of Indiana. Census tracts are not legal boundaries, but are considered stable geographic units used for the presentation of decennial census data.  The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document named ""TGRSHP2011_TECHDOC.PDF (U.S. Census Bureau):  ""Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and are reviewed and updated by local participants prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau updates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data.  ""Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people with an optimum size of 4,000 people. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tracts are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  ""Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.

"Children, Ages 5 to 17, from Families in Poverty in 2004, by School District: Indiana","","Data regarding children (ages 5 to 17) from families in poverty in Indiana in 2004, tabulated by school district, were obtained from a Web page of the U.S. Census Bureau. These data, which are estimates produced under the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program, were then incorporated into a preexisting shapefile showing school districts in Indiana, as of 2000. Data that were obtained for each school district included total population of each district, population of relevant children (ages 5 to 17), and number of children from families in poverty. A new field, giving the percentage of children in each district that are from families in poverty, was calculated by dividing the number of children in poverty by the population of relevant children.  The SAIPE data were produced for school districts as they existed in 2005-2006. It was not possible to find a boundary file for school districts in those years, so a boundary file for 2000 was used. In a few areas, it was not possible to match the SAIPE data with the 2000 school-district boundaries. This is presumably the result of changes (such as mergers or divisions) of school districts between 2000 and 2006.  Regarding the preexisting shapefile showing school districts, the following is excerpted from an online document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to unified school districts (found at http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/sd_metadata.html):  ""School districts are geographic entities within which state, county, or local officials provide public educational services for the area's residents. The U.S. Census Bureau obtains the boundaries and names for school districts from state officials. The U.S. Census Bureau first provided data for school districts in the 1970 census. For Census 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data for three types of school districts: elementary, secondary, and unified.

"Ecoregions, Levels III and IV, Indiana: Indiana","","The following is excerpted from the metadata for OHIN_ECO:  ""The ecoregions shown here have been derived from Omernik (1987) and fr refinements of Omernik's framework that have been made for other projects. These ongoing or recently completed projects, conducted in collaboration with the U.S. EPA regional offices and with state resource management agencies, involve refining ecoregions, defining subregions, and locating sets of reference sites.  Designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental resource management, ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar.  The most immediate needs are to develope regional biological criteria and water quality standards and to set management goals for nonpoint source pollution.  The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of the patterns and the composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity (Wiken 1986; Omernik 1987, 1995).  These phenomena include geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife,  and hydrology.  The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another regardless of the hierarchical level.  Because of possible confusion with other meanings of terms for different levels of ecologic regions, a Roman numeral classification scheme has been adopted for this effort.  Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into nine ecological regions whereas at Level II the continent is subdivided into 32 classes.  Level III is the hierarchical level shown on this map. For portions of the United States the ecoregions have been further subdivided to level IV.  The applications of the ecoregions are explained in Gallant et al. (1989) and in reports and publications from the state and regional projects.  For additional information, contact James M. Omernik, U.S. EPA National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory (NHEERL), 200 SW 35th St., Corvallis, OR 97333 (phone: 541-754-4458).""",eng,"","","Gerber, T. D.|Indiana. Geological Survey|J.

Emergency Medical Service Stations as Developed for the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program: Indiana,"","EMS_STATIONS_HSIP_IDHS_IN is a point shapefile that contains locations of emergency medical service (EMS) stations, as developed for the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). The data were provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) on June 29, 2009. This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI shapefile format and was named ""2008_09_20_IN_EMS.shp.""  The following is a description of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) provided by personnel of the Indiana Geographic Information Council (IGIC):  ""Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP)  After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nation������s critical infrastructure and developed an acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom.  ""HSIP Gold:  Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes. These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as ������disclosure������ in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data.  ""HSIP Freedom: NGA������s goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach ������ HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit.  ""The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the ""License Free������ HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders.""  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDHS for the source shapefile named ""2008_09_20_IN_EMS.shp"":  ""EMS Locations in Indiana  The EMS stations dataset consists of any location where emergency medical services (EMS) personnel are stationed or based out of, or where equipment that such personnel use in carrying out their jobs is stored for ready use. Ambulance services are included even if they only provide transportation services, but not if they are located at, and operated by, a hospital. If an independent ambulance service or EMS provider happens to be collocated with a hospital, it will be included in this dataset. The dataset includes both private and governmental entities.  ""This dataset is comprised completely of license free data.  ""The Fire Station dataset and the EMS dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes.

Values of Moment Magnitude (Mw) are used in this data. Mw refers to the energy released by the event, which is proportional to the slip on a fault multiplied by the area of the fault surface that slips. Events below Mw 3.0 have been omitted, as those events are below the energies felt by humans. Also, all pre-shock and aftershock, non-tectonic (e.g., mine blast), and duplicate event entries have been omitted.

"Estimated Percent Change of Impervious Surface, Derived from the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Database: Indiana","","IMPERVIOUS_SURFACE_CHANGE_2001_2006_USGS_IN is a raster layer (30-meter cell size) containing the percent difference of impervious-surface values in Indiana that changed between NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 and NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness. This raster layer is a subset of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2006) suite of data products.  The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2006:  ""The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle.  These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product.  With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release.  In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date.  To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release.  NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution.  For NLCD 2006, there are 3 primary data products:  1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map; 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Change Pixels labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness.  Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks:  4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table.  In addition to the 2006 data products listed in the paragraph above, two of the original release NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued.  Generation of NLCD 2006 data products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products.  These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release.  A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products.  NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones.  NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process.  As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2006 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes.  Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered ""provisional"" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.

Fire Stations as Developed for the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program: Indiana,"","FIRE_STATIONS_HSIP_IDHS_IN is a point shapefile that contains locations of fire station, as developed for the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). The data were provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) on June 29, 2009. This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI shapefile format and was named ""2008_09_20_IN_Firestations.shp.""  The following is a description of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) provided by personnel of the Indiana Geographic Information Council (IGIC):  ""Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP)  After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nation������s critical infrastructure and developed an acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom.  ""HSIP Gold:  Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes. These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as ������disclosure������ in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data.  ""HSIP Freedom: NGA������s goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach ������ HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit.  ""The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the ""License Free������ HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders.""

Groundwater recharge rates to shallow aquifers: Indiana,"","Aquifer_Recharge_Near_Surface_IN is a raster data layer that displays the results of a regression analysis to determine the estimated rate of diffuse groundwater recharge to the water table in shallow aquifers in Indiana based on numerous landscape-level variables as predictors. The goal of this project was to use an objective, reproducible methodology to estimate groundwater recharge rates in both glaciated and driftless environments. This groundwater-recharge raster layer was developed by combining a multiple regression analysis of groundwater recharge with characteristics of near-surface geologic materials. The groundwater recharge data used in the multiple regression analysis was derived from calculations of groundwater baseflow and surface-water runoff for 279 streams in Indiana. Estimates of groundwater base flow were determined using hydrograph separation analysis (Institute of Hydrology, 1980) determined using a local-minimums approach with a recession slope test, and were converted to recharge by multiplying by using estimates of runoff following Wolock (2003). The baseflow index (BFI) provides the proportion of runoff that is assumed to be groundwater contribution, so recharge was estimated as BFI * interpolated statewide runoff (not runoff per basin). The average annual rate of groundwater recharge (in/year) was used as the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis using ordinary least squares with several landscape and morphometric independent variables representing geologic, terrain, climate, and hydrogeologic characteristics. The regression model developed for Indiana had a global R2 value of 0.50, and the most influential variables at the 95% confidence level were:  - Cumulative percent area of upstream impervious surfaces - Surface clay thickness - Percent of clay in soil - Average annual air temperature - Presence/absence of unconsolidated aquifers - Slope of ground surface - Cumulative percent area of upstream water bodies - Sand composition of water well boreholes - Cumulative percent area of upstream medium-height vegetation - Hydrologic group classification of soil (A,B,C,D - SSURGO)  The regression model was used as a mapping tool to spatially distribute estimates of recharge across Indiana, incorporating details of the important landscape variables.",eng,"","",Indiana.

Historic Wetland Habitats of the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) for Indiana: Indiana,"","WETLANDS_HISTORIC_NWI_USFWS_IN.SHP provides the extent and locations of historic wetland habitats in Indiana.  The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USFWS for the National Wetlands Inventory data:  ""This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of historic wetland habitats in the conterminous United States. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is the principal Federal agency that provides information to the public on the extent and status of the Nation's wetlands and provides stewardship for the wetlands data that comprise the Wetlands Layer of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure. In the formulation of this data layer, historic wetlands are defined as areas where there is evidence that a wetland once existed. This evidence can be from historical map information inventories of past wetland extent or other information collected that relate directly to data on wetland filling, drainage or other modifications. Historic wetlands have been identified using several different techniques depending on the availability and type of information used to locate these areas and user needs. For example, historical maps often provide information about past wetland extent or location and can be useful tools to identify historic wetlands. Historic wetlands have been identified as polygonal data. No linear features have been included. Historic wetland polygons are not classified as wetlands and have no wetland labels or attribution. Since these features no longer exist, boundary delineations are considered approximations based on topography, previously mapped information or indications of historic water levels.""",eng,"","",U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,fst00529442,"",IndianaMAP,Datasets|Web services,Polygon data|Vector data,State government records,Environment|Biology|Geology|Inland waters,Hydrology|2022-creator-sprint,2014,2014-10-20,2014,2014-2014,Indiana,"POLYGON((-88.0157 38.5276, -86.8562 38.5276, -86.8562 37.3724, -88.0157 37.3724, -88.0157 38.5276))","-88.0157,37.3724,-86.8562,38.5276","37.95,-87.43594999999999",false,"","",ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,09a-01,"","","","","","","",Public,Shapefile,,,http://maps.indiana.edu/images/Hydrology/Wetlands_Historic_NWI.png,00b647c9-8bc0-47a2-aa1d-fdc302da0b2f,00b647c9-8bc0-47a2-aa1d-fdc302da0b2f,09a-01,,,2019-03-28,,Active,unpublished,false,false,"",,2021-05-07 17:56:25 -0500,2023-01-26 11:55:58 -0600,,http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Hydrology/Wetlands_Historic_NWI.zip,,,,,,,http://maps.indiana.edu/previewMaps/Hydrology/Wetlands_Historic_NWI.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hospitals as Developed for the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program: Indiana,"","HOSPITALS_HSIP_IDHS_IN is a point shapefile that contains hospital locations, as developed for the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). The data were provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) on June 29, 2009. This data set was provided by IDHS in ESRI shapefile format and was named ""2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp.""  The following is a description of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) provided by personnel of the Indiana Geographic Information Council (IGIC):  ""Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP)  After September 11, 2001, federal decision makers needed a single place to go for geospatial data. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) stood up a tiger team to determine the type of information needed for the nation������s critical infrastructure and developed an acquisition strategy to provide that data to the federal community. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) Working Group provided guidance in the development of the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP). There are currently two different version of HSIP data: HSIP Gold and HSIP Freedom.  ""HSIP Gold:  Designed to combine all geospatial data, and Geospatial Intelligence products into a single, integrated database. HSIP Gold is a collection of base map layers and homeland security related geospatial data. There are many sources, including licensed commodity datasets and Federal & State agency data. The HSIP Gold data was created for Federal government homeland security and homeland defense purposes. These data are only available to state and local governments for viewing purposes across a thin client network. This is referred to as ������disclosure������ in the Federal licensing agreements with the private sector contributors. However, Federal licenses also require that in the event of declared emergencies, that the data may be released to state and local governments to support their operations. Non-government organizations can not access the HSIP Gold data.  ""HSIP Freedom: NGA������s goal is to provide complete datasets with no limits on distribution to state and local responders. The challenge is the private-sector license restrictions. NGA came up with different approach ������ HSIP Freedom where state and local government provide data to DHS or NGA, which could be improved and returned to state and locals so they can get benefit from that data. Then the states would be able to look at same data as federal government and distribute it as they see fit.  ""The current emphasis of the HSIP Freedom program is on sharing and improving data to create uniform State & Federal information on: Fire Stations, EMS Stations & Ambulance Services, Police Stations, Prisons & Jails, Hospitals & Urgent Care Clinics. TechniGraphicS, Inc. (TGS) was the contractor to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for development of this HSIP Freedom data. Most improvements to date have been done by TGS telephoning local officials to verify the name, address, phone number, and geospatial location of their facilities. Geospatial location is determined by asking the local official to describe their location relative to landmarks visible in orthoimagery. TGS incorporates the improved State data into the ""License Free������ HSIP Freedom product and makes it available to the states. They also incorporate the improved State data into HSIP Gold and deliver it to NGA. States are encouraged to share these improved data with the U.S. Geological Survey for use in The National Map and for the new generation of graphic products being produced at USGS for emergency responders.""  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDHS for the source shapefile named ""2008_09_20_IN_Hospitals.shp"":  ""Hospitals in Indiana  ""The term ""hospital"" means an institution which:  ""(1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to inpatients  ""  (A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or ""  (B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons;  ""(5) provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse on duty at all times; ...

Indiana Districts for the 111th Congress: Indiana,"","The following is excerpted from an online document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to cartographic boundary files of congressional districts:  ""Congressional districts (CDs) are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states, based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing CDs for the purpose of electing representatives. Each CD is to be as equal in population to all other CDs in the state as practicable.  The CDs in effect at the time of Census 2000 were those of the 106th Congress, whose session began in January 1999. The boundaries were identical to those reflected in the 107th CD boundary files. The CDs for the 103rd Congress (January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. The 103rd CDs remained in effect through Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting required a change. Six states redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia), five states redistricted for the 105th Congress (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas), and three states (New York, North Carolina, and Virginia) redistricted for the 106th Congress. In North Carolina the ""1998 Congressional Plan A"" was used for the 1998 congressional elections. It was created in response to a court ruling which held the 1997 plan, ""97 House/Senate Plan A,"" unconstitutional. These boundaries are reflected in the 106th CD boundary files. The Supreme Court has since reversed that lower court ruling and the 1997 plan, ""97 House/Senate Plan A,"" (reflected in the 107th CD boundary files) was used for the 2000 North Carolina congressional elections. The 108th Congress is the first to reflect reapportionment and redistricting based on Census 2000 data.""",eng,"","",Indiana. Geological Survey|United States.

This set consists of known sites with Industrial Waste. Industrial Waste Compliance GPS Points locate the entrance to facilities that generate and/or manage hazardous waste, non-hazardous industrial waste, and solid waste. The majority of the points collected are Large Quantity Generators (LQGs). Treatment Storage and Disposal facilities (TSDs) are also being collected. Occasionally, a Small Quantity Generator (SQG) or Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG) GPS points may be collected if the location has significant environmental issues.  GPS data is collected, with portable GPS equipment, by Industrial Waste Compliance staff during scheduled compliance Inspections. GPS points may also be logged at nearby LQGs when the compliance inspector is conducting other compliance work in the area.  TSD - Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility is a facility that may treat, store, and /or dispose hazardous waste. The facility is usually also a generator of hazardous waste.  LQG - Large Quantity Generator is a facility that generates more than 1,000 Kilograms (2,200lbs.) of hazardous waste per month.  SQG - Small Quantity Generator is a facility that generates less than 1,000 Kilograms (2,000 lbs.) but more than 100 Kilograms (220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per month.  CESQG - Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator is a facility that generates less than 100 Kilograms (220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per month.

Also in response to this failure, US EPA initiated a nationwide program assessing the structural integrety and safety of CCW impoundments. US EPA contracted for inspections of these facilities, and information from the reports of Indiana facilities are included in the IDEM developed attributes of these features. The attributes, information about the features in tabular format, were compiled from information taken from the published reports of impoundment inspections done by US EPA contracted firms, and notes from IDEM field inspections, as well as observations made by IDEM GIS staff as the features were digitally mapped. The qualitative and quatitative attributes provide information of impoundment size, capacity, dike/dam hazard potential, types of waste placed in the impoundment, owner, facility name, impoundment use, and field observations by IDEM inspectors and USEPA contrated specialists.  ""The USEPA contracted nation wide reports are found: http://www3.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/industrial/special/fossil/surveys2/index.htm#_ga=1.5580723.182041078.1443707387  ""From the EPA reports: 'A CCW management unit is defined as a surface impoundment or similar diked or bermed management unit or management units designated as landfills that receive liquidborne material and are used for the storage or disposal of residuals or by-products from the combustion of coal, including, but not limited to, fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, or flu gas emission control residuals.

The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked back in to USGS..

DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.""",eng,"","",United States Geological Survey and the United States Environmental Protection Agency,null,"",IndianaMAP,Datasets|Web services,Polygon data|Vector data,State government records,Inland waters|Environment,Lakes|Hydrology|2022-creator-sprint,2016,2016-11-30,2016,2016-2016,Indiana,"POLYGON((-88.8455 46.1023, -83.559 46.1023, -83.559 37.1346, -88.8455 37.1346, -88.8455 46.1023))","-88.8455,37.1346,-83.559,46.1023","41.618449999999996,-86.20224999999999",false,"","",ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,09a-01,"","","","","","","",Public,Shapefile,,,http://maps.indiana.edu/images/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Lakes_LocalRes.png,6e6e45e2-0050-438e-830b-205781ccb7c9,6e6e45e2-0050-438e-830b-205781ccb7c9,09a-01,,,2019-03-28,,Active,unpublished,false,false,"",,2021-05-07 17:56:26 -0500,2023-01-26 11:55:59 -0600,,http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Lakes_LocalRes.zip,,,,,,,http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Land Cover Change, Derived from the 2001 and 2006 National Land Cover Database: Indiana","","LAND_COVER_CHANGE_2001_2006_USGS_IN is a grid (30-meter cell size) showing 2001 to 2006 Land Cover Change pixels in Indiana. This grid is a subset of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2006) suite of data products. There are 17 categories of land use shown in this data set.The pixel attributes are assigned only to pixels that changed land-cover classification between 2001 and 2006, and the attributes are those of the 2006 land-cover classification.  The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2006:  ""The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle.  These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product.  With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release.  In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date.  To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release.  NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 and 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution.  For NLCD 2006, there are 3 primary data products:  1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map; 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Change Pixels labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness.  Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks:  4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table.  In addition to the 2006 data products listed in the paragraph above, two of the original release NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued.  Generation of NLCD 2006 data products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products.  These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release.  A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products.  NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones.  NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process.  As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2006 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes.  Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered ""provisional"" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.  The NLCD 2006 is created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product.  Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.""",eng,"","",Indiana.

There are 15 categories of land use shown in this data set when the associated layer file (LAND_COVER_2006_USGS_IN.LYR) is loaded. The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the NLCD 2006:  ""The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle.  These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product.  With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release.  In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date.  To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release.  NLCD 2006 is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 and 2006 for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution.  For NLCD 2006, there are 3 primary data products:  1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map; 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Change Pixels labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness.  Four additional data products were developed to provide supporting documentation and to provide information for land cover change analysis tasks:  4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change; 5) NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change derived from the raw spectral change analysis; 6) NLCD 2001/2006 From-To Change pixels; and 7) NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates and scene identification numbers included in the attribute table.  In addition to the 2006 data products listed in the paragraph above, two of the original release NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued.  Generation of NLCD 2006 data products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness data products.  These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 data products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release.  A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products.  NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones.  NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process.  As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2006 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes.  Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered ""provisional"" until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.  The NLCD 2006 is created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product.  Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.""",eng,"","",Indiana.

"Meteorological, Soil-Water, and Groundwater Monitoring Stations: Indiana","","WATER_BALANCE_NETWORK_IN.SHP is a point shapefile that shows the locations of thirteen meteorological, soil-water, and groundwater monitoring stations maintained by personnel of the Center for Geospatial Data Analysis, Indiana Geological & Water Survey (IGS). Each of the monitoring stations has been located in a unique hydrogeologic setting in Indiana. Meteorological sensors include tipping bucket rain gages, air temperature and relative humidity sensors, pyranometers and net radiometers (used to measure natural solar radiation fluxes), and anemometers. Unsaturated-zone instrumentation is installed at nine of the glaciated terrain sites and includes soil-moisture and temperature sensors (at most sites, located at depths of one foot to six feet below the ground surface).

"National Sediment Inventory (NSI) and Data Summaries, Derived from EPA BASINS 3: Indiana","","SEDIMENT_INVENTORY_EPA_IN is a point shapefile from the National Sediment Inventory developed by the USEPA BASINS 3.0 program and edited by Bernardin, Lochmueller and Associates. Points represent monitoring stations attributed as occuring within the state of Indiana or along the Ohio River in Kentucky, or in Illinois along Lake Michigan. Joinable tables must be utilized to access data at specific stations for specific parameters. Five tables are available - tissue residue data (tischem.dbf), sediment chemistry data (sedichem.dbf), screening value, cancer slope factors, and noncancer reference doses for chemicals (reftabl.dbf), watershed summary data (watersh.dbf), biotoxicity data (biotox.dbf).  US Environmental Protection Agency BASINS metadata reports -  ""This dataset describes the accumulation of chemical contaminants in river, lake, ocean, and estuary bottoms and includes a screening assessment of the potential for associated adverse effects on human and environmental health. EPA evaluated more than 21,000 sampling stations nationwide using sediment chemistry data, chemical residue levels in edible tissue of aquatic organisms, and sediment toxicity data. Of the sampling stations evaluated, 5,521 stations were classified as Tier 1 (associated adverse effects are probable), 10,401 stations were classified as Tier 2 (associated adverse effects are possible, but expected infrequently), and 5,174 stations were classified as Tier 3 (no indication of associated adverse effects). Ninety-six watersheds were identified as areas of probable concern for sediment contamination. EPA believes that these watersheds represent the highest priority for further ecotoxicological assessments, risk analysis, temporal and spatial trend assessments, contaminant source evaluation, and management action because of the preponderance of evidence in these areas (although further evaluation is necessary). Also see the related report entitled The Incidence And Severity Of Sediment Contamination In Surface Waters of the United States, Volume 1, National Sediment Quality Survey (EPA 823-R-97-006, <http://www.epa.gov/OST>) that was published in September 1997. For distribution with BASINS v.2.0, the spatial attributes of the database were prepared in Arcview shape file format while selected relational attributes were prepared in Arcview DBF file format.""

Nationwide Rivers Inventory: Indiana,"","Dataset includes all Indiana river reaches on the Nationwide Rivers Inventory (NRI) listed by the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). The file was created using 1:100,000 scale data from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), therefore, the lines remain in the NHD reaches, resulting in multiple line segments for each NRI listing. The line segments have NOT been dissolved. The start and end point of each listing segment is approximate and located by described landmarks.  The following excerpt from the NPS, NRI website describes the eligibility for a river to be listed-  In order to be listed on the NRI, a river must be free-flowing and possess one or more Outstandingly Remarkable Values (ORVs). Thus, the eligibility analysis consists of an examination of the river's hydrology, including any man-made alterations, and an inventory of its natural, cultural, and recreational resources. There are a variety of methods to determine whether certain resources are so unique, rare or exemplary as to make them outstandingly remarkable. The determination that a river area contains ORVs is a professional judgment on the part of the interdisciplinary study team (IDT), based on objective, scientific analysis. Input from organizations and individuals familiar with specific river resources should be sought and documented as part of the process. In order to be assessed as outstandingly remarkable, a river-related value must be a unique, rare, or exemplary feature that is significant at a comparative regional or national scale. Dictionary definitions of the words ""unique"" and ""rare"" indicate that such a value would be one that is conspicuous example from among a number of similar values that are themselves uncommon or extraordinary. Only one such value is needed for eligibility.������",eng,"","",Bernardin-Lochmueller & Associates|United States.

The listing was published in the Indiana Register on March 1 of that year as Information Bulletin #4 in Volume 16, Number 6, page 1677 through 1680 (sometimes cited as 16 IR 1677). The listing has also been specifically incorporated by reference into statutes and rules.

Predicted Responses of Geologic Materials to Seismically Induced Ground Shaking: Indiana,"","SEISMIC_SHAKING_PREDICTED_RESPONSE_RP35_IN is a polygon shapefile that shows the distribution and classification of National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) soil types. This shapefile represents the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic materials throughout Indiana.  The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground shaking. NEHRP links the physical properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave velocity propagation, to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of their performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A through F, the correct NEHRP soil class is best determined from the average shear-wave velocity of the soil column.  Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5):  A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08. Note that Class A is not present in Indiana.  B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0.  C - Hard and (or) stiff to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2.  D - Sands, silts, and (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180 to 360 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6.  E - Small to moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index greater than 20, moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is less than 180 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5.  F - Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable soils, quick and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification factor is not applicable.  The following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35:  ""The distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven shear-wave velocities were measured in soft sediments at various localities throughout Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole methods in freshly augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave profiles from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile from one other site in Vanderburgh County. These data, coupled with the thickness of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the potential amplification of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having an epicenter within Indiana or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance the performance of the computer program HAZUS, developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess damage scenarios.  ""Plate 1 of this report, a map of Indiana at a scale of 1:500,000 showing the predicted response of geologic materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended only for regional planning purposes and is not a substitute for on-site shear-wave measurements and geotechnical data. Continued field work is anticipated, the results of which will enhance the accuracy and value of the map.""",eng,"","",Indiana.

The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USGS for the local-resolution NHD feature class named ""NHD_LOCALRES_AREA_IN"":  ""This dataset was improved to local resolution (1:2,400) as part of the Indiana Local Resolution NHD Project. The following process is done by subbasin: high-resolution NHD geodatabase is checked out from USGS; six-acre catchment areas and streams are generated using best-available digital elevation model; areas, flowlines, and waterbodies are digitized to the 6-acre limit using the best available aerial photography, adding ftype to each feature; attributes from high-resolution NHD are conflated to the new linework; subbasin geodatabase is checked back in to USGS.. After the successful completion of the previous steps, the subbasin is downloaded from USGS; the NHDArea, NHDFlowline, and NHDWaterbody feature classes are reprojected to UTM NAD 83 Zone 16N; the reprojected NHDArea features are loaded into this dataset. DESCRIPTION FROM USGS: The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.""",eng,"","",United States Geological Survey and the United States Environmental Protection Agency,null,"",IndianaMAP,Datasets|Web services,Polygon data|Vector data,State government records,Inland waters|Environment,Spillway|Ditch|Rapids|Hydrography|Bridges|Hydrology|Waterbody|Spillway|Dam|Weir|Streams|Bridges|Rivers|Canals|Inundation area|Lock chamber|2022-creator-sprint,2016,2016-11-30,2016,2016-2016,Indiana,"POLYGON((-89.1831 46.3002, -83.0473 46.3002, -83.0473 36.9879, -89.1831 36.9879, -89.1831 46.3002))","-89.1831,36.9879,-83.0473,46.3002","41.64405,-86.1152",false,"","",ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,09a-01,"","","","","","","",Public,Shapefile,,,http://maps.indiana.edu/images/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Rivers_LocalRes.png,13de1fee-d18a-4257-8497-f0749f94a60a,13de1fee-d18a-4257-8497-f0749f94a60a,09a-01,,,2019-03-28,,Active,unpublished,false,false,"",,2021-05-07 17:56:26 -0500,2023-01-26 11:56:02 -0600,,http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Hydrology/Water_Bodies_Rivers_LocalRes.zip,,,,,,,http://maps.indiana.edu/layerGallery.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sand and Gravel Resource Potential in Mapped Surficial Material: Indiana,"","SAND_GRAVEL_RESOURCES_IN is a polygon shapefile that identifies sand and gravel permissive tracts in the surficial unconsolidated deposits of Indiana.  Permissive tracts have been defined by the U.S. Geological Survey (Open File Report 95-681, Singer, D.A., 1993, Basic concepts in three-part quantitative assessments of undiscovered mineral resources: Nonrenewable Resources, v. 2, no. 2, p. 69-81) as ""areas where the geology permits the existence of mineral deposits (mineral resource potential) of a specific type... Noting that the possibility of the occurrence of the specified deposit type (mineral resource) outside the permissive tract should be negligible."" This shapefile provides an approximate economic ranking of the sand and gravel resource potential of each mapped surficial unconsolidated deposit.  The resource potential of each map unit within the mapped surficial unconsolidated deposits is ranked as a ""potential,""  ""low potential,"" or ""not a potential"" resource. The definitions of these rankings are derived from Gray, H. H., 1973, Properties and uses of geologic materials in Indiana: Indiana Geological Survey Regional Geologic Map Supplementary Chart 1 and Carr, D. D., and Webb, W. M., 1970, Sand and gravel resources of Indiana: Indiana Geological Survey Bulletin 42-D, 31 p.  ""Potential resource"" indicates that the surficial unconsolidated deposits are likely to contain economic concentrations of sand and gravel, ""low potential"" indicates that the surficial unconsolidated deposits may contain economic concentrations of sand and gravel, and ""not a potential resource"" indicates that the surficial unconsolidated deposits do not contain economic concentrations of sand and gravel.",eng,"","",Indiana.

Many other datasets are referenced to this mileage information, and therefore this dataset is considered by the Division of Water to be the official mileage for these streams.  ""Stream mileage maps for streams in Indiana were originally developed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Louisville, Detroit and Chicago districts) and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, from 1965 ������������������ 1973. These maps depict stream mileages in tenths of a mile (with exceptions) mapped on USGS 7 ������������ minute quadrangle maps, at a scale of 1:24000. Methodology for determining stream mileage largely follows the document ������������������River Mileage Measurement������������������, Water Resources Council, 1968. Points representing each tenth of a mile were captured by DNR staff using georectified copies of the original source documents. These points are attributed with the stream name as shown on the original documents, and the basin, from the Division of Water standard basin schema. This dataset was developed in 2016.  ""Updated hydrographic dataset sources (namely the USGS National Hydrography Dataset) are captured to a much finer resolution than was possible when this data was originally compiled. Additionally, rivers and streams are dynamic, eroding and depositing material and changing course over time, sometimes significantly. Limitations of this dataset compared to other derivations of stream mileage should be recognized.  ""Stream mileage for the Ohio River were taken from the USGS 7 ������������ minute quadrangle maps, and are shown at 1 mile increments. Mileage for the Ohio River is historically taken as miles from Pittsburgh (the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers).  ""Discrepancies in the original maps include: Missing mileage data for miles 569-579 for the Ohio River in the Bethlehem quad, an extra 1/10 of a mile between miles 66.5 and 67 for Sugar Creek in Basin 19, an extra 1/10 of a mile between miles 17.5 and 18 for Middle Fork Blue River in Basin 27, an extra 1/10 of a mile between miles 17.5 and 18 for Little Calumet River in Basin 1.""",eng,"","",Indiana.

"Thickness Ranges of the Springfield Coal Member (Petersburg Formation, Pennsylvanian) in West-Central Indiana: Indiana","","In the past a series of reports on coal resources of selected counties in Indiana was published as part of the Special Report series of the Indiana Geological Survey.

The thickness maps were based on coal-test records, mine-map notations, and interpretations of geophysical logs that are included in the files of the Indiana Geological Survey.

Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI): Indiana,"","WETLANDS_NWI_USFWS_IN.SHP provides the extent and locations of wetlands and deepwater habitats in Indiana.  The following is excerpted from metadata provided by the USFWS for the National Wetlands Inventory data:  ""This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the United States and its Territories. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of 'farmed wetlands' as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Wetlands Project Metadata layer, which contains project specific wetlands mapping procedures and information on dates, scales and emulsion of imagery used to map the wetlands within specific project boundaries.""",eng,"","",U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,fst00529442,"",IndianaMAP,Datasets|Web services,Polygon data|Vector data,State government records,Environment|Biology|Geology|Inland waters,Hydrology|2022-creator-sprint,2014,2014-10-20,2014,2014-2014,Indiana,"POLYGON((-88.0157 38.5276, -86.8562 38.5276, -86.8562 37.3724, -88.0157 37.3724, -88.0157 38.5276))","-88.0157,37.3724,-86.8562,38.5276","37.95,-87.43594999999999",false,"","",ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,09a-01,"","","","","","","",Public,Shapefile,,,http://maps.indiana.edu/images/Hydrology/Wetlands_NWI.png,779116b9-9a38-402d-ab9e-0d747421ca18,779116b9-9a38-402d-ab9e-0d747421ca18,09a-01,,,2019-03-28,,Active,unpublished,false,false,"",,2021-05-07 17:56:25 -0500,2023-01-26 11:56:04 -0600,,http://maps.indiana.edu/download/Hydrology/Wetlands_NWI.zip,,,,,,,http://maps.indiana.edu/previewMaps/Hydrology/Wetlands_NWI.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZIP Code Tabulation Areas: Indiana,"","ZCTA_TIGER05_IN.SHP is a polygon shapefile that contains ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA's) for the state of Indiana. This data set has been updated using the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2005 TIGER/Line Files (First Edition), which contain updated ZCTA's reflecting U.S. Postal Service ZIP Code changes through October, 2002. There will be no further updates of ZCTA's until required for the 2010 Census.  The following is excerpted from an Adobe Acrobat PDF document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs):  ""ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs������) are a new statistical entity developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for tabulating summary statistics. ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They represent either USPS five- or three-digit ZIP Code areas. ZCTAs are created based on the following criteria:  ������ ZCTAs follow census block boundaries. The ZCTA code for each census block generally represents the majority ZIP Code of the addresses within that census block.  ������ ZCTAs are not exact representations of the USPS������s ZIP Code delivery areas.  ������ ZCTA codes cover all land and water areas.  ������ ZCTAs include some dedicated post office box ZIP Codes in areas served only by post office boxes.  ������ ZCTAs representing post office box ZIP Codes generally have more than 10 addresses.  ������ ZCTAs exclude unique, single delivery point ZIP Codes, such as those for firms and organizations.  ������ ZCTAs are distinct from other Census Bureau statistical areas, such as census tracts, because they are not stable over time and are computer-delineated based on the location of addresses at the time of Census 2000 rather than manually delineated by local program participants or Census Bureau staff before the census.  ������ ZCTAs are distinct from other representations of ZIP Codes because they are based on address information and ZIP Codes collected or verified during Census 2000 operations.  ������ ZCTAs frequently cross county and place boundaries and may occasionally cross from one state into another.""  For a more detailed discussion of how the U.S. Census Bureau created ZCTAs, please open one of the Adobe Acrobat files found at http://www.census.gov/geo/ZCTA/zcta.html  The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by INDOT for the source shapefile DOTGIS.ZCTA5_TIGER05_IN.SHP:  ""The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries.  The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation.  The 2005 First Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries.""",eng,"","",United States.
